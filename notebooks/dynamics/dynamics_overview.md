# Dynamics Overview

In order to have a computational model that solves predictive equations, we need to understand what equations we are trying to solve! In this future chapter, we will (a) introduce the fundamental equations of the atmosphere used in dynamical models (i.e., the "Basic Equations"), (b) show how they can be simplified in order to make solutions tractable, (c) separate them into base state and perturbation components (i.e., Reynolds Averaging), and finally (d) show how they might be analyzed in their continuous forms prior to discretization. While these sections of the cookbook are not yet available in its current version, we suggest exploring the following resources if you wish to learn more about these topics in the meantime:

- Chapters 2â€“5 of {cite:t}`Pielke02`
- {cite:t}`CushmanRoisinBeckers11`

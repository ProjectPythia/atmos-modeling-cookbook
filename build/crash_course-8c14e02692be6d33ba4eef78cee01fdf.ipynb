    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",

    "The following notebook serves as a crash course in constructing a simple two-dimensional mesoscale atmospheric numerical model. To begin, we select a closed set of dynamical equations, in line with {cite:t}`Klemp1978-dq` (hereafter KW78). Necessary assumptions are stated to simplify the equations into a manageable form to maximize both computational and educational applications. Pre-defined model configurations are presented (in an attempt) to ensure numerical stability. Equations are converted into finite-differences and then broken down into Python code to explicitly demonstrate the construction of a numerical model. Additional resources will be provided in the future regarding varying model configurations and utilizing increasingly more realistic and complex model equations."

    "In this notebook we construct a two-dimensional, dry, and compressible atmospheric model that is broadly in line with KW78, though several assumptions and choice configurations were made to simplify the current model for computational and educational efficiency.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "1. We will only consider the zonal ($x$) and vertical ($z$) components.\n",
    "2. Base-state variables are a function of $z$ only, denoted by $\\overline{\\phi}$.\n",
    "3. Water-vapor is neglected (i.e, $q_{v}, q_{r}, q_{c} = 0$), so  $T_{v} = T$ and/or $\\theta_{v} = \\theta$.\n",
    "4. Coriolis force, microphysics, and Turbulence are also neglected(i.e., $f, M_{\\theta}, D_{\\theta} = 0$).     \n",
    "5. As in KW78, the $f_{\\pi}$ term in Pressure Equation (PEQ4-3) is neglected due to its negligible influences on convective-scale processes along with sound and gravity waves.\n",
    "6. Sub-Grid Processes require parameterizations in order to achieve model closure. For example, sub-grid turbulence is first obtained using Reynolds Averaged prognostic variables (i.e., breaking up variables into mean and turbulence components), and then must be parameterized using additional assumptions (such as the flux-gradient approach). \n",
    "7. The current test case is designed to have a calm and isentropic base-state (i.e., $\\frac{\\partial \\overline\\theta}{\\partial t}$ and  $\\overline{U} = 0$)"

    "The preceding cookbook provided a crash-course on the development of a 2-D Mesoscale Numerical Model, starting with the basic dynamical equations through the conversion to computer code and ultimately model integration. This pre-configured \"test-case\" is intended to be used for educational purposes only. Note that all the assumptions/configurations used herein may not be applicable for other situations. Future notebooks are to be included, demonstrating how various configurations (i.e., equation simplifications, discretization schemes, boundary conditions, grid styles, and spatiotemporal resolutions) all influences the performance and accuracy of the resultant output. Additionally, we plan to include explicit walk-throughs regarding stability analyses, corrections, and filtering techniques. Check-in regularly for updates to this Cookbook.\n",

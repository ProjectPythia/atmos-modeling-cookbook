# Summary

This cookbook is a work in progress, and while we hope that the introductory section and the referenced materials have been useful, there are several more aspects yet to come in the future! These include:

- Interactive and code-based examples in the prior sections
- Additional graphics and figures
- Additional applied examples in different types of simple atmospheric models (such as tropical waves, a tornado-like vortex, and more)
- Approaches for assessing and comparing model implementations and outputs

Recommended resources to come soon!

# Dynamics Overview

In order to have a computational model that solves predictive equations, we need to understand what equations we are trying to solve! In this future chapter, we will undertake to introduce the fundamental equations of the atmosphere used in dynamical models (i.e., the "Basic Equations"), how they are simplified in order to make solutions tractable, how they are separated into base state and perturbation components (i.e., Reynolds Averaging), and finally how they might be analyzed in their continuous forms prior to discretization. While these sections of the cookbook are not yet available in its current version, in the mean time, we suggest exploring the following resources if you wish to learn more about these topics:

- Chapters 2â€“5 of {cite:t}`Pielke02`
- {cite:t}`CushmanRoisinBeckers11`

In atmospheric science, the equations of interest are those that govern the behavior of the atmosphere, such as the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow, the thermodynamic energy equation, and the continuity equation for mass conservation, among others. These equations are integrated forward in time to make predictions about the future state of the atmosphere based on current conditions. These equations are very complex (as will be seen later) and difficult to solve, and small variations in the initial conditions (the state of the atmosphere at time 0) and the boundary conditions (the state of the atmosphere on the edges of the domain of interest) can yield wildly different results. Modeling with the use of numerical solving methods is necessary to make these predictions as it allows us to simplify those complicated physical processes via discretization and utilize numerical integration to simulate a plausible future state of the atmosphere.","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"key":"tmmx9Xy43C"}],"key":"wofLk3fSwD"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1},"end":{"line":9,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Now that you know what an atmospheric model is and how it uses numerical integration to make its projections, we’re ready to discuss the process of building your own!","position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1},"end":{"line":9,"column":1}},"key":"LvBvQEBDbl"}],"key":"foFKXgafnO"},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":11,"column":1},"end":{"line":11,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"What are the Key Steps of Numerical Modeling?

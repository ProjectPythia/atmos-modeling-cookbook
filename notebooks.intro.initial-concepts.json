In atmospheric science, the equations of interest are those that govern the behavior of the atmosphere, such as the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow, the thermodynamic energy equation, and the continuity equation for mass conservation, among others. These equations are integrated forward in time to make predictions about the future state of the atmosphere based on current conditions. These equations are very complex (as will be seen later) and difficult to solve, and small variations in the initial conditions (the state of the atmosphere at time 0) and the boundary conditions (the state of the atmosphere on the edges of the domain of interest) can yield wildly different results. Modeling with the use of numerical solving methods is necessary to make these predictions, as it allows us to simplify those complicated physical processes via discretization and utilize numerical integration to simulate a plausible future state of the atmosphere.","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"key":"GL8No4TeCJ"}],"key":"L9YixACC8n"},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1},"end":{"line":9,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"What Meteorological Information Will My Model Use?","position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1},"end":{"line":9,"column":1}},"key":"BymlBHcIvH"}],"identifier":"what-meteorological-information-will-my-model-use","label":"What Meteorological Information Will My Model Use?","html_id":"what-meteorological-information-will-my-model-use","implicit":true,"key":"qvhCeWQxbt"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":11,"column":1},"end":{"line":11,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Atmospheric models range from huge simulations of the entire Earth as a coupled system, considering the atmosphere, ocean, land, and ice and how they interact with one another, to those that focus on the microscale processes that can’t be seen and are challenging to understand (think: cloud microphysics, radiation, turbulent processes), and everything in between!

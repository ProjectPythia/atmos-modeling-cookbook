# Coordinates and Initial/Boundary Conditions

In the prior section when we discussed methods of solution, we did not explore all the considerations involved in the *coordinate systems* of the grids upon which the equations are discretized, nor the initial and boundary conditions that help define and constrain the solutions. Those will be the focus of this future chapter. In particular, we will showcase different representations of geospatial coordinates, the advantages and disadvantages of various grid staggering techniques, vertical coordinate systems, and all the different varieties of boundary conditions (for the horizontal, model bottom, and model top). While these sections of the cookbook are not yet available in its current version, in the mean time, we suggest exploring the following resources if you wish to learn more about these topics:
